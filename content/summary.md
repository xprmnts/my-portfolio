I've covered a lot of ground in terms of what and how I influence things that get built in many industries; from nanotechnology to ecommerce - as a researcher, product manager to name a couple roles.

Currently, I'm considering a transition from product management to software engineering. I've been interested in software engineering for many years and decided to make the jump now.

As a software engineer, I hope to add a unique POV by bringing with me a deep curiosity to understand customer needs and business challenges that I've been immersed in as a product manager.
