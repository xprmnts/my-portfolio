After graduating with a background in Nanotechnology, I found myself eager to be a part of the IT ecosystem for the better part of the last decade. With each experience I got closer; getting exposure to just about every facet of a software company from sales, support, product and now to development.

As a software engineer, I assert a customer focused POV by bringing with me a deep curiosity to understand customer needs and business challenges that I've been immersed in as a product manager.

I'm currently seeking Full Stack / Front-End / Back End opportunities.
